Once upon a time there was a computer science student named John. John couldnt remember how to use git commands and asked his brother Aaron how to clone his repository. Aaron told him to use git clone. His friend Josh tried to edit his story, however, he did not know how. Fortunately, John knew how to do this and now Josh is happy. 

Unfortunately, before Josh edited John's story, he forgot to save his story so that Joe could edit. Joe accessed the story before the final save was done by Josh. This caused a conundrum the likes of which have never been seen...
